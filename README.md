# Inkies
Inkies is an underwater action game featuring design and art by my school-aged cousin.

## Gameplay
Inkies supports multiple input mechanisms:
- Use the arrow or WASD keys to move. Press space to ink nasties.
- Use the virtual d-pad to move and ink nasties.
- Click and drag to move and ink nasties.

Avoid nasties and get a high score.
